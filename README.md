# ABoatScraping
Scrapes ship information from Wikipedia. Because all of the information is user-sourced, most formatting is not consistent page to page.

# Set Up
1. Install pipenv
2. Install dependencies through pipenv
3. Set 'SHIP_SCRAPER' environment variable to point to module directory

# Demo
**NOTE**: The demo may take a while to load because of free Heroku hosting--the server needs to load the app into its cache.
